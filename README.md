## Architecture

### Data Pipeline
```
5000 Raw Contractors (Original JSON)
    ↓ [Cleanup + 14 Trade Classification]
4000+ Clean Contractors (Master_Sheet.csv)  
    ↓ [Completion Score Filtering: 80+]
~1500 High-Quality Prospects
    ↓ [Focus Intel AI Generation]
105+ Ready Campaigns (MASTER_CAMPAIGN_DATABASE.json)
    ↓ [Operations Center]
Hub V4 (Adaptable: Works with 105 or 4000)
```

### Technical Stack
- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, Vanilla JavaScript (optimal performance)
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express (lightweight, scalable)
- **Data Layer**: JSON + CSV bidirectional (filesystem persistence)
- **UI**: Custom glassmorphism with adaptive scaling
- **Components**: Modular architecture for scalability

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ 
- Access to data sources:
  - `Master_Sheet.csv` (4000+ contractors)
  - `MASTER_CAMPAIGN_DATABASE.json` (105+ campaigns)

### Installation

1. **Clone and setup**
   ```bash
   cd contractor-intelligence-hub-v4
   npm install
   ```

## UI/UX Design

### Glassmorphism Dark Theme
```css
/* AI Vortex Dark Palette */
--background: hsl(240, 10%, 4%)           /* Deep Dark Background */
--foreground: hsl(0, 0%, 97%)             /* Pure White Text */
--primary: hsl(199, 89%, 48%)             /* Electric Blue */
--secondary: hsla(220, 13%, 18%, 0.5)     /* Glass Surface */
--accent: hsl(142, 76%, 36%)              /* Success Green */
--warning: hsl(45, 93%, 47%)              /* Amber Warning */
--destructive: hsl(346, 87%, 43%)         /* Error Red */
```

### Adaptive Scaling Modes
- **Compact** (2000+ contractors): Grid optimized for high data density
- **Balanced** (500-2000 contractors): Perfect balance of detail and efficiency  
- **Detailed** (<500 contractors): Full information display with larger cards

### Visual Effects
- **Backdrop blur**: `backdrop-filter: blur(20px)`
- **Hover transforms**: `translateY(-4px)` with smooth shadows
- **Completion gradients**: Conic gradients for score visualization
- **Status animations**: Color-coded indicators with transitions

## Data Management

### Data Sources Integration
1. **Master_Sheet.csv**: 4000+ contractors with completion scores
2. **MASTER_CAMPAIGN_DATABASE.json**: 105+ ready campaigns  
3. **Execution State**: Real-time campaign tracking

### Unification Process
```javascript
// Smart matching by business_id
const unifiedContractor = {
    // Base data from CSV
    business_id, company_name, category,
    primary_email, phone, website, address,
    
    // Completion metrics
    data_completion_score, business_health,
    sophistication_score, trust_score,
    
    // Campaign overlay
    has_campaign, campaign_data, campaign_status,
    
    // Enhancement tracking
    completion_tier, missing_fields,
    improvement_suggestions, score_history
};
```

### Bidirectional Sync Flow
```
Dashboard Changes → unified-data.json → CSV Export
    ↓
External Updates → CSV Import → Dashboard Refresh
    ↓
Focus Intel → Campaign Generation → Dashboard Overlay
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "Data unification failed"
```bash
# Check data source paths
ls -la "/Users/manuayala/Documents/LAGOS/01_BUSINESS_ACTIVE/outreach_app/NORMALIZER/01_PROCESSED/CONTRACTORS - Master_Sheet.csv"
ls -la "/Users/manuayala/Documents/LAGOS/FOCUS_INTEL_SYSTEM/MASTER_CAMPAIGN_DATABASE.json"

# Re-run setup
npm run setup
```

#### "Server won't start"
```bash
# Check port availability
lsof -ti:3000

# Kill existing process
kill -9 $(lsof -ti:3000)

# Start with different port
PORT=3001 npm start
```

#### "Contractors not loading"
```bash
# Check unified data file
ls -la data/master-contractors.json

# Trigger manual unification
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/data/unify
```

#### "UI looks broken"
- Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+Shift+R)
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors  
- Verify CSS files are loading properly
- Test in Chrome/Firefox for compatibility

### Debug Mode
```javascript
// Enable debug logging in operations.js
localStorage.setItem('debug', 'true');
// Refresh page to see detailed logs
```

### Performance Issues
```bash
# Check memory usage
node --max-old-space-size=4096 backend/adaptive-server.js

# Monitor with activity
top -p $(pgrep -f "adaptive-server")
```
