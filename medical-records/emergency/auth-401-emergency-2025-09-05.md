# EMERGENCY - Authentication 401 Production Issue
Date: 2025-09-05

## SYMPTOMS
- User can login successfully with Google OAuth (manuel@aivortex.io)
- After login, user is redirected to main page
- Main page shows "No contractors found" 
- All API calls to /api/simple-contractors are returning 401 Unauthorized
- Console shows continuous 401 errors in Vercel logs
- Frontend shows 4,107 total but 0 showing

## PATIENT HISTORY
Authentication flow:
1. Google OAuth login at /simple-login
2. Sets localStorage: authorized=true, userEmail, userName, userPicture
3. Main page checks localStorage and redirects if not authorized
4. fetchWithAuth adds 'authorization': 'authorized' header
5. API routes use withAuth wrapper that checks for 'authorization' === 'authorized'

## RECENT CHANGES
- Fixed middleware to allow API routes through
- Fixed header case from 'Authorization' to 'authorization'
- Still getting 401s

## EXAMINATION PLAN
1. Verify authentication flow end-to-end
2. Check header transmission in production
3. Examine middleware configuration
4. Test API authentication wrapper
5. Identify production vs dev environment differences

## CRITICAL DIAGNOSIS
üö® AUTHENTICATION LOGIC FLAW DETECTED!

**ROOT CAUSE:** Browser header transmission issue
- Client sets localStorage 'authorized' = 'true' ‚úÖ
- Client sends header 'authorization' = 'authorized' ‚úÖ  
- Server checks header === 'authorized' ‚ùå

**THE PROBLEM:** 
Browser headers are case-insensitive and may be processed differently in production vs dev. The server is looking for exactly 'authorized' but may be receiving variations.

**EVIDENCE:**
1. Login works (localStorage set correctly)
2. Redirect works (client-side auth check passes)
3. API calls fail with 401 (server-side auth check fails)
4. fetchWithAuth sends 'authorization': 'authorized'
5. withAuth expects exactly 'authorized'

## TREATMENT PLAN
1. Add debug logging to API route to see actual header values
2. Check for case variations and null values
3. Test simple header transmission in production
4. Fix authentication logic to be more robust
