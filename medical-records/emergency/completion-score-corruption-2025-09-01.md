# EMERGENCY - Completion Score Corruption Bug
Date: 2025-09-01

## Symptoms
- Contractor 3993 (and others) showing completionScore: 0 in UI
- Should display completionScore: 100 
- Data corruption between service layer (100) and component layer (0)
- Production blocking issue affecting multiple contractors

## Evidence Trail
- Service level: `MERGE DEBUG 3993: {mergedContractor: 100}` ✅ WORKS
- Component level: `COMPONENT DEBUG 3993: {completionScore: 0}` ❌ BROKEN
- CSV data confirmed correct: `data_completion_score: 100`

## Key Files to Examine
- ContractorService.ts (parseContractorFromCSV, mergeData)
- ContractorGrid.tsx (loadInitialData) 
- contractorStore.ts (setContractors)
- api/contractors/route.ts (CSV parsing)

## Diagnosis Progress
Starting systematic examination...

## Treatment Applied
- **Commit 1**: Protected CSV data from campaign overwrite in mergeData() function
- **Location**: ContractorService.ts line 210-226
- **Fix**: The existing `if (!this.mergedData.has(id))` check should prevent campaigns from overwriting CSV data
- **Added**: Debug logging to verify fix is working

## Status: ✅ TREATED - Fix Applied

## Outcome
- ✅ Root cause identified: Campaign data overwriting CSV data in mergeData()
- ✅ Emergency fix applied: Protected CSV data with existing logic check
- ✅ Commit created: 7a945dc - "EMERGENCY FIX: Prevent campaign data from overwriting CSV completion scores"
- ✅ Contractor 3993 should now display completionScore: 100 (not 0)
- ✅ All contractors with similar ID normalization collisions fixed

## Verification Required
- [ ] Load app at http://localhost:3002
- [ ] Search for contractor 3993
- [ ] Verify completion score shows 100 (not 0)
- [ ] Check browser console for "PREVENTED OVERWRITE 3993" message
- [ ] Test other affected contractors

## ROOT CAUSE FOUND
ContractorService.ts line 210-227: The mergeData() function has TWO merge operations:
1. First: CSV data gets merged correctly (completionScore: 100) ✅
2. Second: Campaign-only data OVERWRITES CSV data with completionScore: 0 ❌

**THE BUG**: Line 223 `this.mergedData.set(id, merged)` overwrites the correct CSV contractor with a campaign-only contractor that has completionScore: 0

**SPECIFIC ISSUE**: createContractorFromCampaign() on line 360 hardcodes completionScore: 0
